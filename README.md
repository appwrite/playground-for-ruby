**Work in progress**

## Get Started

This playground does not adhere to Ruby best practices but rather is intended to show some of the most simple examples and use cases of using the Appwrite API in your Ruby application. Rubocop is enforced and the configuration can be found at [.rubocop.yml](.rubocop.yml)

## Requirements 
* A system with Ruby 2.7+ or Docker installed.
* An Appwrite instance (localhost in most cases).
* An Appwrite project created in the console.
* An Appwrite API Key created in the console.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into the repository.
4. Open [playground.rb](./lib/playground.rb) and update YOUR_PROJECT_ID, YOUR_ENDPOINT, and YOUR_API_KEY using the copied values from the console.
5. Run the playground:
    Ruby:
        - Install dependencies using bundle (`bundle install`)
        - Execute the command `bundle exec ruby lib/playground.rb`
    Docker:
        - Execute the command `docker compose up`
6. You will see the JSON response in the console.
